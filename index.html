    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Goodreads is a popular website that is used by authors and readers to organize, discover, and post books. Despite
      the popularity the webiste is sorely outdated and has many frustrating UI elements that hinder the user
      experience. Once such issue is how books are shared with friends. Naturally, you want to be able to connect with
      friends, see their activity, and read their reviews. However, the most basic function of "sharing" is odd. The app
      forces you to go through multiple through third-party platforms like <i>messages</i> only to then send a basic url
      that the user has to copy themselves onto a browser. For both sender and reciever, it is a convulated process so
      many don't use this feature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Example below:</p>
    <div class="examples">

      <section class="example-one">
        <h4>Step 1: Click share icon (far right)</h4>
        <img src="images/example1.png" alt="User copying the Goodreads book URL from the browser address bar">
      </section>

      <section class="example-two">
        <h4>Step 2: Copy URL</h4>
        <img src="images/example2.png" alt="User pasting the Goodreads link into a messaging app">
        <p>After copying the URL, the user will have to <i>manually</i> select their messaging app to then type in their
          friend's name. However, some people you meet online you might not be as personal with. And the other options
          are also lacking in versatility.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="example-three">
        <h4>Step 3: The receiver clicks the URL and gets redirected</h4>
        <img src="images/example3.jpg" alt="User opening the Goodreads share menu with external share options">
        <p>The reciever is redirected back to goodreads, however, if they are not signed into their phone or don't have
          the app downloaded. They are sent to a browser and will be forced to sign in from there.</p>
      </section>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution-card">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My solution is to create a more streamlined method of sharing, for instance, once you select your book and click
      <i>share</i> your friend's page will show up and allow you select which friend to send it to or there is a <i>send
        all</i> option as well. Once sent, the book will be placed into the friend's book recommendation shelf generated
      by the webiste. For context, a <i>shelf</i> in goodreads is how a users books are organized. There are three that
      are part of the app which is <i>read, want to read, and currently reading</i>; however, users can create custom
      shelves as well. It would make sense to integrate the sharing into a feature that already exists in the app.
